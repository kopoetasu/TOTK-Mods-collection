# How to Download and Update Phoenix BIOS for Free
 
Phoenix BIOS is a type of firmware that controls the basic functions of your computer system. It is stored on a flash memory chip on your motherboard and can be updated to improve performance, stability, compatibility, or security. Updating your BIOS can also fix some common problems such as boot failures, blue screens, or hardware issues.

However, updating your BIOS can be risky if you don't follow the proper steps or use the correct tools. If you flash the wrong BIOS file or encounter a power outage during the process, you may end up with a corrupted or unusable system. Therefore, it is important to backup your current BIOS before attempting any update and to follow the instructions provided by your motherboard manufacturer.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and update Phoenix BIOS for free using three different methods: DOS-based flasher, Windows-based flasher, and UEFI-based flasher. These methods are suitable for different types of Phoenix BIOS: PhoenixBIOS, Phoenix-Award BIOS, and Phoenix UEFI BIOS.
  
## DOS-based flasher
 
A DOS-based flasher is a program that runs in a DOS environment and allows you to flash your BIOS from a floppy disk, USB drive, or CD-ROM. This method is compatible with most PhoenixBIOS and Phoenix-Award BIOS versions. To use this method, you will need:
 
- A bootable DOS media (floppy disk, USB drive, or CD-ROM)
- A compatible Phoenix BIOS flasher (phlash.exe) and BIOS file
- A backup of your current BIOS

You can download the latest Phoenix BIOS flasher (phlash.exe) and BIOS file from [PhoenixBIOS.com](http://www.phoenixbios.com/) or [Wim's BIOS](https://www.wimsbios.com/phoenixflasher.jsp). You can also use [BIOSAgentPlus](http://www.phoenixbios.com/) to scan your computer and find the right updates for your system. Make sure you download the correct BIOS file for your motherboard model and revision.
 
You can create a bootable DOS media using a program like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [Hiren's BootCD](https://www.hirensbootcd.org/). You will need to format the media as FAT32 and copy the DOS system files to it. You can also copy the Phoenix BIOS flasher (phlash.exe) and BIOS file to the same media.
 
You can backup your current BIOS using the Phoenix BIOS flasher (phlash.exe) with the /b option. For example:
 `phlash /b backup.bin` 
This will create a backup file named backup.bin on the same media. You can also use other options to customize the flashing process. For more information, type:
 `phlash /?` 
To update your BIOS, boot your computer from the DOS media and run the Phoenix BIOS flasher (phlash.exe) with the name of the BIOS file as an argument. For example:
 `phlash newbios.bin` 
This will flash the new BIOS file named newbios.bin to your motherboard. Do not turn off your computer or interrupt the flashing process until it is completed. When it is done, reboot your computer and enter the BIOS setup to verify the update and adjust any settings if needed.
  
## Windows-based flasher
 
A Windows-based flasher is a program that runs in a Windows environment and allows you to flash your BIOS from within Windows (32 bit and 64 bit versions). This method is compatible with most PhoenixBIOS and Phoenix-Award BIOS versions as well as some Phoenix UEFI BIOS versions. To use this method, you will need:

- A compatible Phoenix BIOS flasher (winphlash.exe or winphlash64.exe) and BIOS file
- A backup of your current BIOS
- A stable power supply
